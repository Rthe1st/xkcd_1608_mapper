import antigrav function switches the screen upsidedown
window.python("import antigravity")

there's coins, if you get the, ship transforms

earth has some werid random function going on

```js
("earth" === n.opts.name &&
  Math.abs(t - 31523) < 400 &&
  Math.abs(e + 34629) < 400 &&
  Math.random() > 0.5) ||
  (r ? n.update(i) : n.remove());
```

ships can have sheidls, and pssibly different engines?
and there's an inf probabiltiy drive

setting

```
window.ship.engines = "infinite improbability drive"
window.ship.engines = "warp"
```

how do you get these legit?

mean you just teleport between planets

window.ship.sheilds controls sheilds, but i tink its jsut graphical?

Loc notes

from window.Comic.voyager.pos
you start at x: 0, y: -1459

other side of the planet is x: 0 y: 1815
origin is loc 0,0 - this is the middle of the planet
radius 630
width/height 4096

the radius is well inside the painted boundary of the planet

THis is the code that makes everything twice and big and y negtaive
function Jn(t) {
const [e, n] = t;
return [2 * e, 2 * -n];
}
const Qn = Nn(
Vn.Kl,
({ loc: t }) =>
() =>
Jn(t)
),

Setting Comic.cameraRotation = false really helps prove the picture matches watches expected

stragtigies for drawing gravity wells

abs vel:
calculate abs vel for each pixel (or larger space)
and grey-scale colour space, 0 for no graivty, 255 for lots

To get per planet wells

- give each planet a color, calcualte net direction of pull, colour with that planet it's pointing to?
  Or use 0 vel areas as borders, and then use grey scale gradient within each border for intensity
